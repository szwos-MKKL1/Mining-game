# Mining-game
Game focused on mining, crafting (sounds familiar huh?), roguelike progress, and some combat.

## Map generation
Settings:
* Random cost min and max, lower values produce more scattered and curved paths (works well with negative values)
* Distance multiplier, higher values make path more straight, following the best path
